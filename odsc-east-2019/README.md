## Declarative Data Visualization with Vega-Lite & Altair (ODSC East 2019)

This directory hosts materials for the "Declarative Data Visualization with Vega-Lite & Altair" workshop at ODSC East 2019.

### Dependencies

Please install Jupyter Lab, Vega-datasets and Altair.  

```
pip install -U altair==2.4.1 vega_datasets jupyterlab
```

Note that Altair 3.0 works better with Jupyter Lab 1, which is currently in a pre-release stage, so you may want to use Altair 2.4.1 for now.
